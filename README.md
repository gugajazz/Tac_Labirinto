# Tac Labirinto
## _A assembly game built for my Technologies and Computer Architecture course._

Developed by myself and a colleague, built on top of some template code previously provided.

If you are interested in a more detailed description please refere to our report, present in the folowing file ```Relatorio Labirinto TAC.pdf```

## Running and playing it for yourself

It must be ran in a 8086 emulator, we'll use DOSbox.
- Install DOSbox by runnuning "DOSBox.exe" provided on the "Masm" directory
- Copy the "8086" folder provided on the "Masm" directory to your "C" drive (C:\8086)
- Copy the 3 files ```avatar.asm```,  ```labi.txt``` and ```titulo.txt``` to the ```C:\8086``` directory
- Run DOSbox
- On the console type ```mount c c:\8086``` -> ```c:``` -> ```ml avatar.asm``` -> ```avatar```

Now to play simply navigate the maze to run over all the letters in the assigned word before the time runs out, the faster you are the higher you'll score.
